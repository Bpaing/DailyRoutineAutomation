# DailyRoutineAutomation
The main motivation for this was for my Japanese study routine.

I got tired of opening files and applications everytime I started my computer, so I made these Python scripts.

It uses the runtime of open files to determine what to open on next startup.



UPDATE 04/25/2022

At this point, the original logic I wanted to create is finished. Below are some things I would like to implement in the future.

- Perform backup routine after monitoring program is terminated
- Optimize monitoring code
- Modularize code to work with any type of viewable file
- Implement a system that checks if a file is closed on the last page, add the next sequential file in the directory to the list instead
- Implement GUI application so I can change the number of URLs and files to open whenever I feel like it. Also for additional visual confirmation.
